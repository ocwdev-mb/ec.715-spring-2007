description: 'This human-powered vacuum pump was developed by EC.715 students on the
  Vac-Cast project for use in rural clinics. Using the pump, technicians can make
  a mold in sand around an amputated limb, to quickly and cheaply cast a fitted prosthesis.
  This technology won $7,500 funding in the ''06-''07 MIT IDEAS Competition. Image
